// NPM

//we'll install one of the packages in npm -- validator.js (to validate str: email, phone no etc)

//to install it: npm i validator

//what change is in package.json, there's dependencies. It means our app relied on the package
//another change is we have folder: node_modules. This folder stored the packages those we need in dependencies. We only installed one, so we only have a folder named validator
//another thing is we have package-lock.json (this file will organise in detail for our dependencies). We will not edit this file. If there's change, we'll do it in package.json.

//we can also uninstall the package. Go to 41
